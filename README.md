# Equity Analysis

## Overview
This project automates the process of collecting, storing, and analyzing fundamental financial data for companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. It scrapes detailed financial statements from Screener.in, calculates the intrinsic value of each companyâ€™s stock using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, and provides a user-friendly interface to filter and explore companies based on key financial metrics.

## Features
- Retrieves a complete list of NSE-listed companies using the `nsepython` library.
- Automates data extraction from Screener.in using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- Handles rate limiting by adding delays between web requests to avoid blocking.
- Stores general company fundamentals in a SQLite database.
- Saves detailed financial statements (balance sheet, profit & loss, cash flow) in MongoDB.
- Logs companies not found on Screener.in in a blacklist for reference.
- Calculates intrinsic value per share using a DCF valuation model.
- Provides a PyQt5-based graphical user interface to filter companies by market cap, ROE, current price, sector, and industry.
